# pc-disassembly-reassembly
This project documents the complete disassembly and reassembly of a **Dell Inspiron 660** desktop computer.  
The primary goal was to gain and demonstrate **hands-on experience** with computer hardware, while also creating clear **documentation** that explains the process step by step.  

Through this project, I developed practical skills in hardware handling, component identification, and system reassembly,  
and produced a resource that can guide others in performing similar tasks safely and effectively.
